# ElasticSearch-in-AWS
This is a public repo detailing the training steps I have taken to learn Elasticsearch in AWS using Jupyter Notebooks.

This repo is very basic and aims to give you just what you need to get started with Elasticsearch. 

There is a Medium post which provides more details about this work and the steps required to setup Elasticsearch in AWS.
